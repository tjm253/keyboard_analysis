# keyboard_analysis
Keyboard analysis tool runs a series of tests on a sample text file to find the statistics of a given keyboard layout. In keyboard_analyzer_live_script.mlx, point to the wanted keyboard layout that you wish to analyze. For dvorack, copy its full file name such as

C:\Users\user1\MATLAB Drive\Keyboard_Analysis\keyboard_layouts_en\dvorak.txt
or
/home/user1/home/Documents/MATLAB/Keyboard_Analysis/keyboard_layouts_en/dvorak.txt

run the live script to analyze the keyboard statistics. I still need to properly label the outputs, but the keyboard frequency output is aethetically pleasing.
